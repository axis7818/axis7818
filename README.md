### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cameron Taylor (he/him). I'm pretty good at typing at a computer. Usually it does what I tell it to.

I am a Software Engineer on Microsoft's [CSE (Commercial Software Engineering) team](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/CSE.html) where I work with customers in the Media industry to help tackle their toughest technical problems in the cloud.
I am also an engineer on the [Worldspinner team](https://ui2.worldspinner.com/) where we build software tools for the tabletop gaming community such as the upcoming mobile app, [Portrait Workshop](https://portraitworkshop.squarespace.com/).
