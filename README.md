### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cameron Taylor (he/him). I'm pretty good at typing at a computer. Usually it does what I tell it to.

I am a Senior Software Engineer on Microsoft's [ISE (Industry Solutions Engineering) team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industrysolutions) where I work with Microsoft's customers and partners to tackle their toughest technical problems in the cloud.
I am also an engineer on the [Worldspinner team](https://ui2.worldspinner.com/) where we build software tools for the tabletop gaming community such as the upcoming mobile app, [PortraitWorks](https://www.portrait.works/).
